# LibEtude

LibEtude is a specialized AI inference engine for voice synthesis. Unlike general-purpose AI frameworks, it's highly optimized for the voice synthesis domain, providing modular architecture and hardware optimization for real-time processing and cross-platform support.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Specific Optimization**: Focused on voice synthesis operations to eliminate unnecessary overhead
- **Modular Kernel System**: Hardware-specific optimizations (SIMD, GPU) for optimal performance across platforms
- **LEF (LibEtude Efficient Format)**: Efficient model format reducing file size by 30% with differential model support
- **Real-time Voice Synthesis**: Low-latency processing with streaming capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on desktop, mobile, and embedded environments
- **High-Performance Math Library**: Optimized mathematical functions for voice synthesis operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Designed for constrained resource environments
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for dynamically adding new features

## Project Goals

1. Create an extremely optimized voice synthesis engine
2. Support multiple hardware platforms with native optimizations
3. Provide real-time performance with minimal latency
4. Maintain high quality voice synthesis with efficient resource usage
5. Enable extensibility through plugins and model extensions
